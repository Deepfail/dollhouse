# Agent TODO â€” Manual Backlog (2025-09)

**Quality gates:** Keep `npm run build` green and document any additional checks you run.

## Ready for pickup

1. **Behavior analytics foundation**  
   Replace the placeholder XP/affection increments in the main chat with a proper conversation-analysis pipeline that scores behavior, extracts highlights, and surfaces a concise summary to the UI. Persist results so they can evolve over time.

2. **Desktop chat composer visibility**  
   Ensure the message composer and send button stay visible on desktop for both the main chat pane and the copilot sidebar. Introduce support for optional multiple-choice reply buttons when a flow provides them.

3. **Copilot sidebar refresh**  
   Add chat-history deletion controls, introduce a tabbed layout (existing copilot context plus a dedicated copilot chat tab), and keep the layout optimized for landscape displays.

4. **Roster management upgrades**  
   Add character deletion, separate tabs for different character groups, improved creation flows, and richer editing tooling (including prompt regeneration, a "Physical" tab for appearance attributes, a "Value" tab for holistic evaluations, a revamped feed, and a renamed "Prompts" tab).

5. **Import/export and rooms groundwork**  
   Wire up character import from supported formats and lay the foundation for room creation/upgrades with editable prompts that can be used during group scenes.

> Update, reprioritize, or add to this list as product needs evolve. The agent should pause once the active request is complete.
