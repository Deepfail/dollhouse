# API Key Saving Issue - Fixes Applied

## Problem
The OpenRouter API key was not being saved properly, causing all chats to fail with "Configure your API" errors.

## Root Causes Identified
1. The useKV hook was not properly persisting data to the KV store
2. There was a race condition between form state and KV store updates
3. Components were not properly reacting to API settings changes
4. Missing validation between form state and actual saved state

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced API Settings Save Function (`HouseSettings.tsx`)
- Added direct KV store access to bypass potential useKV issues
- Implemented dual-save approach (both direct KV and hook update)
- Added comprehensive verification system
- Better error handling and debugging

### 2. Improved House Hook (`useHouse.ts`)
- Enhanced updateHouse function with better validation
- Added API key validation debugging
- Improved functional update handling

### 3. Better API Status Checking (`Copilot.tsx`)
- Created `isApiConfigured` variable for reliable API status checking
- Enhanced debug logging with KV comparison
- Added proper API validation before message sending
- Improved visual status indicators

### 4. Enhanced Debug Information
- Added KV storage inspection button
- Real-time verification of save operations
- Better error messages and success confirmation

### 5. Improved Error Handling
- Added proper API key validation before all operations
- Better user feedback for missing configurations
- Clearer error messages throughout the system

## How to Test the Fix

1. Open House Settings â†’ API tab
2. Enter your OpenRouter API key (sk-or-v1-...)
3. Click "Save API Settings"
4. Check that the debug info shows "Values Match: YES" and "Valid Check: VALID"
5. Check that the Copilot sidebar shows "OpenRouter Connected" (green)
6. Try starting a chat - it should work without "Configure your API" errors

## Additional Debugging Tools Added

- "Check KV Storage" button in API settings to inspect raw KV data
- Enhanced console logging for all API operations
- Verification system that confirms saves worked correctly
- Real-time status updates in the Copilot sidebar

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- API keys save reliably and persist across sessions
- All components immediately recognize when API is configured
- Chat system works properly with configured API
- Clear visual feedback showing API connection status
- Better error messages if configuration fails
