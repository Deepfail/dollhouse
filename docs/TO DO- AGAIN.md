# TO DO- AGAIN

Keep the overall app and Copilot column fixed-height; messages must scroll instead of stretching the layout.
Separate Copilot vs. main chat pipelines so drafts and sends never cross-talk.
Restore prompt editor behavior: all fields save, each prompt has a “Generate” button, and the image prompt builder comes back pulling character traits.
Re-enable per-session deletion in the chat history list.
Bring back the group chat flow with hidden roles and autoplay.
Remove the [Analysis]… inserts from the chat stream and surface that insight in the character card instead.
Reinstate the character image tools: image prompt generator, direct image creation code, and the “tap avatar to upload or generate” interaction.
