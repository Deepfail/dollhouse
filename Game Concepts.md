## Copilot/wingman/lover/orchestrator/tool

okay...heres the idea...copilot is a character/tool/storyteller/friend/lover....i basically interact with the entire app through the sidebar. i say "send lumi into my room" that opens up a chat with lumi coming to my room under whatever circumstances we were speaking of in the conversation with the context provided as prompts. lets start there. this feature was working now its broken. help me get it working again and build on this idea of mine of using a copilot as more than a copilot
