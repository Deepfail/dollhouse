# DOLLHOUSE SANDBOX DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK

## THE PROBLEM
- Making changes blind without seeing the running app
- Breaking working features constantly  
- No clear component hierarchy understanding
- Guessing at fixes instead of debugging properly

## THE SOLUTION: DEVELOPMENT SANDBOX

### 1. COMPONENT TESTING PLAYGROUND
Create a dedicated testing environment where we can:
- Test individual components in isolation
- See immediate visual feedback
- Debug component props and state
- Make incremental changes safely

### 2. CLEAR COMPONENT MAPPING
Document the actual component hierarchy and data flow:
```
App.tsx
├── Layout.tsx
│   ├── Sidebar.tsx (characters/chats)
│   ├── UniversalChat.tsx (main chat interface)
│   └── UniversalToolbar.tsx (controls)
├── Copilot.tsx (AI assistant)
└── Various overlays/modals
```

### 3. DEBUGGING TOOLS
Build in-app debugging tools:
- Component state viewer
- Props inspector  
- Event logger
- Error boundary with clear messages

### 4. INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
1. Make ONE small change at a time
2. Test immediately in the sandbox
3. Verify no regressions
4. Document what worked/didn't work
5. Only then make the next change

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Build Development Dashboard
- Create DevDashboard.tsx component
- Add component testing playground
- Add real-time state inspection
- Add error logging and display

### Phase 2: Component Documentation
- Map out all component props and interfaces
- Document the actual data flow
- Create component usage examples
- Build prop validation

### Phase 3: Safe Development Workflow
- Feature flags for new changes
- Rollback capability
- Component isolation testing
- Regression test suite

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. Build a DevDashboard that shows component state
2. Fix the UniversalToolbar by actually debugging what's wrong
3. Create a testing environment where we can see changes work
4. Stop making blind changes and start building systematically

This way when you're working with me, you're not punching yourself in the face - you're building something that actually works and grows properly.
